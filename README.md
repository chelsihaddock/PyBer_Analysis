# PyBer_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
 * An analysis for PyBer, a ride-sharing business, was performed as requested by the CEO. Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib were used to create the DataFrame and multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The results will be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

* The amount of rural drivers is limited due to the demand which causes the price per ride to be significantly greater than suburban or urban rides. 
* There are fewer urban rides than there are drivers which means the demand is low. This could be due to pricing or even brand awareness.

* All three city types begin to see a rise in demand mid-February which levels out by April. 
 
## Summary
 * For the urban area, I'd recommend that PyBer take advantage of the excess amount of drivers in comaprison to the need. After running an analysis on wait time, they could market the lack of wait time to increase the amount of rides each driver is having in an average work day. This could increase rides and profitability for the drivers. This should also promote retention and satisfaction for the drivers in turn creating a better experience for the customer (riders).
